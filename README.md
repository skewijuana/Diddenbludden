# READ
this is an archive of a **really shitty** and messy discord token + ip logger i wrote a while ago out of boredom. (may not even work lmaoo i dont really tested it in months)
steal it if you want to, i dont care like at all.
if you want to compile this you will need some python shit i dont even remember
**im not going to teach you how to compile this, as im just archiving the 2 files** - you will need hxdiscord_rpc though
expect this to suck, this is just an unfinished archive

# how it work
this reads your tokens and saves them in temp files, the python script decrypts them and saves them in another temp file, then the temp files get deleted and the data gets sent through a discord webhook.

# How..
```actionscript
new Diddenbludden().troll();
```
